In this demo, I implement the Deutch-Jozsa algorthm and test its error rates when run on IBM quantum computers.

The Deutch-Jozsa (DJ) algorithm is a quantum algorithm used to decide if a given function is even (all outputs are the same number) or balanced (half of the outputs are 0 and half are 1). The DJ algorithm can decide with a query complexity of 1.

When run on real quantum computers at IBMQ, the error rate rises exponentially with the number of qubits.
